# VisaCzecker
If you are waiting for a decision about your visa application in the Czech Republic you should know that the only way to have daily updates about your application is to go on https://frs.gov.cz/en/ioff/application-status put your number in the form and get the current status. Unfortunately, there is no way to receive updates automatically. This application is designed to solve this problem. When it will be done you will be able to install the app on your mobile device, put your application number, and then you can open it and have a look at the current status of your visa. Automatic updates about status are gonna be delivered automatically on your device in-app.

In the future, there will be added push notifications, so you don't even be needed to open your app. When there is will be any changes, the app automatically will notify you.
